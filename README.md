## Running the 'app'
If you don't have git or any other developer tools installed on your machine, no worries, you can still download and run the code.

Find the green button in the upper right hand of this page which reads 'Clone or download'. Click and choose to download zip. When the file downloads, double click to extract the zip archive. Try double clicking on the index.html file, if it will either open a text editor or a web browser. If the code doesn't open a browser you can right click on the file and choose to open with a web browser to see the code in action!
